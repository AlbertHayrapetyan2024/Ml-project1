# Ml-project1
This is Ml project1 of tumo labs

# Online payments fraund detection
# What does the project do
my project takes the dataset, separates the learning and learning parts, performs training using a decision tree classifier and performs prediction on the learning data. Then calculates the accuracy and does data visualization.

# How is the project useful
By using my code users can detect the online payments thief before he steals.

# How users can get started with the project
Users can simply feed my code a dataset similar to the newly used dataset and detect whether or not that user has committed payment theft.
